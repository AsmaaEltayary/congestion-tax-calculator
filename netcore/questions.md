Is a UI required as entrypoint for the assignment? or swagger is enough
i have added 2 version of webApi.net v1:for rules in Gothenburg which is red from Json file
and v2 the rules are read from SQL server DB
so in develop ment mode you need to run these commands  add-migration "Creating-DB"    update-database -verbose
i have created the docker file for the webapp , but due to the time constarints the dockercompose might need more time
